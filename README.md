# BERT-based-Multi-Label-Text-Classifier-with-Active-Learning-Continuous-Learning-and-Custom-AutoML
The repository uses a BERT-based multi-label text classifier for uncertain sample selection and real-time model improvement, with Optuna as a custom AutoML framework for hyperparameter optimization. This model is designed for large-scale classification tasks, especially review text, and can be fine-tuned based on user feedback.
